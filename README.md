# python-basic-oops-notes
ECE engineer here! Learned Python/ML during internship. Everyone said it's "very hard" - it's actually fun! ðŸŽ‰ Real challenge? 12hrs coding = destroyed back ðŸ’”   Originally wrote code with curse words like `why_wont_this_work` and rage-filled comments. AI transformed my chaotic spaghetti into professional code. Now my GitHub looks legit! ðŸ˜‚âœ¨
